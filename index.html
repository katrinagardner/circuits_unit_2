<h1> Which two website are you most inspried by?</h1>

<li><a href="https://ayr.com/">AYR</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/">THE NEW YORKER</a></li>


<h1>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h1>

<p> <strong> The New York  </strong></p>
<p> The New Yorker uses big font headlines as a focal point along with images of advertisements. 

The visual hierarchy is made very clear by the font size. Below the focal point headline, they used font sizes to create a sub-line for all categories in the article sections. 

The website uses white negative space to create a more clean-looking webpage. As you can see, once you scroll down the webpage, they use different grid layouts and different font-sizes /colors to mark up the importance of each section. The navigation of this website is very clear and easy to use. </p>

<p><strong> AYR </strong></p>

<p>The AYR uses a big image as a negative space along with a big font to create a focal point for the newest edition collection. 
They use a lot of different size fonts to create visual hierarchy. The webpage has a very simple and clean design.</P>


<h1>What makes them similar and different?</h1>

<p>Both websites use different size fonts to create the importance for the subject.
For ARY they use photo shoot pictures as a background of the webpage and try to keep the main webpage as clean and simple as possible. The New Yorker uses a more traditional way of laying out all their categories.</p>

<p>For this Thumbnail sketch assignment I created a shoe company webpage.

The first sketch is the home page of the website, and I used the newest collection ad video as a focal point. Then I created equal grid layouts for a nice visual balance for the category sections.

On the second page, to introduce what is new, I used unbalanced grid-layouts to have an interesting visual design but at the same time also try to keep all categories on the left side so they look well organized. I used a large font size to show the importance of the new arrivals.

For the individual product web page, the main focal point is a big screen with an image slideshow, along with all the details and information on the right side of the screen. Below the screen there are small icons for social media website and e-mail share functionality. </p>
